## Quick Install Guide
Edit: It has come to my attention that Unity's Package manager, while supporting git, does not come with any embedded git install. I am looking into solutions ^^
For now, if you cannot install the package, you probably need to install git manually from https://git-scm.com/download/win

Open Unity's Package Manager and add the git url 

```https://github.com/blepmlem/VRChat-Expression-Utility.git#2.0.0```

# VRChat Expression Utility
This tool allows you to skip all of the tedious work when setting up new expressions in SDK3 Avatars.
With Expression Utility you can automatically generate every part of many common expressions based on presets; Quickly set up a new radial puppet for switching between outfits, a toggle for turning on a hat, and many more!

Creating a new expression with the tool allows for the automatic generation of:
- VRChat Menu Controllers
- VRChat Parameters
- Animation Transitions based on the VRC parameter
- Animation Parameters based on the VRC parameter
- Animation Layers
- Animation Clips

Other features include the ability to view/delete each VRC parameter and relationships with associated objects such as Animation Clips, Animator Layers, Conditions, Menus, etc.
