# VRChat Expression Utility
This tool allows you to skip some of the tedious work when setting up new expressions in SDK3 Avatars.

This tool can automatically generate everything you need for a rudimentary toggle expression with a click of a button. From there you can always modify the output to fit other needs.

Creating a new expression with the tool allows for generation of:
- VRChat Menu Controllers
- VRChat Parameters
- Animation Transitions based on the VRC parameter
- Animation Parameters based on the VRC parameter
- Animation Layers
- Animation Clips

Have fun! <3
